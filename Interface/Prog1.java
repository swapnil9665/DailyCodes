//1. If we want to implenment 100% abstraction then we can use interface
//2. we can also implement multiple inheritance by implementing multiple interface in single class
//3. if we implement an interface in class then we need to give body to it's method otherwise we should declare that class as abstract class
// 4. Each method in interface is by default public abstract
